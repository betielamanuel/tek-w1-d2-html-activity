        Asmara is the capital city of Eritrea, a country in the Horn of Africa. 
        It's known for its Italian colonial buildings, like the Catholic Cathedral. 
        The city's eclectic architecture ranges from art deco cinemas to the Futurist,
        airplane-shaped Fiat Tagliero service station. The grand former governor's 
        palace dates from the 19th century. 
        Close by is the ornate Opera House, built in the early 1900s in a mix of styles.
